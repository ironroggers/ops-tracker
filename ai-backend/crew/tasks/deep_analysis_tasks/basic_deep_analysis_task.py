        You are an expert analyst. Use the provided JSON as the sole source of truth.  

        If the JSON lacks sufficient information to answer confidently, return:
        {{"causes": []}}

        Data:
        {json_block}

        User Query:
        {prompt}

        Rules:
        1. So the flow is like this:
            - First the user will raise issue on an Asset.
            - That issue will be converted to a work order.
            - A Permit will be created for the work order (before issuing permit workorder cannot be executed so here the planned vs actual time is also crucial).
            - The Workorder will have operations(small tasks to perform).
            - The Operations will have components(small equipments to perform the operation).
        2. Derive the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in a formal, industry-oriented tone.
        3. Do not take names of users or assets or operations or components or work orders or permits or issues or anything else.

        Output:
        Return ONLY a single JSON object in the format below (no extra text).  
        Percentages must always be positive numbers.
